This is a list of notes to my future self.  
He will probably ignore them as he is still a moron

### Things you think can wait but can't

  - Authentication
  - Authorization
  - Validation
  - Consistent logging pattern
  - Deployment pipeline up untill production
  - Monitoring
  - Fake *all* external dependencies on localhost by default
    - webservices
    - filesystems
    - repositories (db or otherwise)

### Important things you never do

  - Write out your scenarios to find your data and processes
  - List of nouns (remember params parms parameters? yeah..)

### Minimize bikeshedding

  - .editorconfig / resharper rules
  - lint
  - break builds for style errors (I know, it sucks)
